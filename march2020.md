# Cloud Native March 2020

## Cloud State of Play, Richard Simon, World Wide Technology

Word Wide Tech have an Advanced Tech Centre (ATC) data centre that users can view and learn from. https://atc.com allows you to play with it yourself!

### Introduction

Focus is on cloud migration strategies, optimising their approach, rather than a deep technical outlook.

### Journey to the Cloud

Digital distruption is forcing a multicloud architecture - public cloud vs multicloud
You shouldn't "move to the cloud" just for the sake of it! (Dilbert cartoon on Kubernetes)

"Heritage DataCentre" - Traditional IT and "transitional" IT -> monolithic
Transitional = knee-jerk reaction, e.g. HCI, OpenStack, Software Defined Infrastructure, SD(everything) Converged Infra -> i.e. a convergence.

Developed into a hybrid cloud - specific workloads into a cloud environment.

SAP and Oracle tend to remain in the data centre (or go into an MSP environment) - hard to just "move".

Movement to microservices, CI/CD pipelines, faster development, automation and automation of config management

WHat about security? -> DevSecOps is a focus now.

The "goal" is "serverless" and infrastructure as code - get spot instances and only pay for what you actively use.

  - "World engines" - describe the world that you want and a machine creates the environment.

### Migration Strategies

- Migration into cloud native does NOT save money.
  - Instead, it increases business agility/flexibility
  - Broader geographic distribution

- "The 6 Rs" - Retiring, rehosting, refactoring, Repurchasing, Replatforming (putting it on a different platform host), Rewriting
  - As your application moves to the cloud, you have to move data to the cloud too, whether cost-effective cloud database or new tech that allows you to apply into existing data for insights.
  - Backup recovery / replication as solutions you need to consider for cloud too

### Cloud Native Architecture

You need to consider the architecture as a whole. It's not just infrastructure modernisation, it's a wider strategy, an architecture (multicloud, public cloud) question, with observability and security baked in.

###Â Cloud Operating Model

The two most important parts to get right:

- Connectivity - from static IP host-based to dynamic IP and service-based
- Security - from High trust account-based to low/zero trust identity-based. Two pods sitting next to each other should not trust each other.
- From dedicated hardware to capacity on demand in provisioning

### Conclusions

- Journey to the cloud: Have a cloud strategy! You need to actually write a document to plan the process out. A "Cloud Charter" that everyone signs up to and supports.
  - Look at options/choices between hybrid/public/multicloud - what is the best option for your immediate needs? What about into the future?
  - Computing unit size: needs to be well-defined for each work load considered. Dedicated container or can you run it as a serverless function?

- Migration into the cloud: Plan your journey, plan your automation, plan your optimisation. You need to find a way to automate the migration for all your applications.
  - Optimise your expenditure, see if partial moves to the cloud can offer you a saving.

Cloud Native Architecture:
Design for a cloud native operating model!

- Don't just copy and paste your security policies from your on-premises/Data Centre model!
- Look at the way to migrate all parts of your application - entire database etc! Is it still worth it monetarily?

Other considerations: Security? Observability? Data management, infrastructure security

## Build and test GCP Infrastructure Using Terraform Module, Pradeep Bahadani, Cloud Native Technologies (founder)

### Terraform

- Open-source tool to build infrastructure as declarative code.
- Lifecycle: 4 stages
  - `Terraform init` to initialise repository and modules
  - `terraform plan` to execution plan
  - `terraform apply` to actually execute this with the cloud API to create resources.
  - `terraform destroy` to get rid of resources

- On GCP, the complexity of the platform (storage, service ccount, Web Server, Subnets, etc) means that multiple instances are a pain to create the same way.
  - You can create the code, but it's environment-specific for each project. Leads into code duplication and possible security / divergence issues.
  - Solution: Terraform Modules

### Terraform Modules

- Modules: Abstract your logic into a function and call the function with arguments you provide (e.g. environment specifics)
  - Re-usable: Helps avoid code duplication.
  - Collaborative development - resides in a single repository
  - Helps you to get started quickly with different platforms - c.f. Docker registry!
- Passing variables to terraform module, calling different values in different blocks, and the function gets executed each time for each block.

### Testing

- Frameworks: Open source test frameworks e.g. Test Kitchen - Ruby files defining tests
  - Lifecycle - `create`, `converge`, `verify`, `destroy`.

# Cloud Native London Meetup Notes

This is a repository of files I will keep my notes from Cloud Native London Meetups. They are not intended as authoritative, and will vary in quality depending on circumstances, such as my understanding level of the topic. They were written from my perspective and are intended for consumption by me and possibly colleagues. If they are useful to you, wahey. Let me know if they are.

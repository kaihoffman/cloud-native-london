## Rethinking Security From Scratch: The case for Shifting Container Security from the Edge to the Core

### Chris Milsted, VMware

- "Why you shouldn't do the smallest container image for the people reasons, rather than computing reasons"

- OCI Containers: Containers constructed from layers/images, with inheritance: Containers will pull only what they don't have cached
  - Overlay2 file system in the layers, which is actually mountable!

- Options: Distroless? Scratch image?
  - Scratch to be avoided as an antipattern(!)
  - Distroless: Using multi-stage builds without building a massive machine that can do everything (no development kits!)
    - But in terms of security: You want a container that can build code, but a runtime that contains only enough to run the application rather than build/have other issues with compliance. Solution: Build a builder and inject the result into a base image?
  - Scratch: Initialise empty layer, inject a binary into the layer, run the binary
  - Layer isolation: "AN application fully isolated in a container must be self-contained" - e.g. namespages, CGroups, Kernel capabilities...
    - But this has gone "wrong"
      - might be 7.4MB ('good') but operationally this is "bad": A large organisation won't remember an obscure single-layer container and its contents! And then you can't shell into it, for example!
    - Pattern of observability at the edge is the current security model
      - CVEs are linked to Common Platform Enumeration that matches the packages, which match the distro!
      - The problem becomes introspection of what was built!
        - You should put in versions, metadata etc into your binaries that anyone running the app gets a chance to view commits, references, etc
      - OpenSecurityAgent Admission Controllers can control for vulnerabilities in code, but there is no good solution yet - every solution currently would be a custom one.

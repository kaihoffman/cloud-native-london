## Rethinking Security From Scratch: The case for Shifting Container Security from the Edge to the Core

### Chris Milsted, VMware

- "Why you shouldn't do the smallest container image for the people reasons, rather than computing reasons"

- OCI Containers: Containers constructed from layers/images, with inheritance: Containers will pull only what they don't have cached
  - Overlay2 file system in the layers, which is actually mountable!

- Options: Distroless? Scratch image?
  - Scratch to be avoided as an antipattern(!)
  - Distroless: Using multi-stage builds without building a massive machine that can do everything (no development kits!)
    - But in terms of security: You want a container that can build code, but a runtime that contains only enough to run the application rather than build/have other issues with compliance. Solution: Build a builder and inject the result into a base image?
  - Scratch: Initialise empty layer, inject a binary into the layer, run the binary
  - Layer isolation: "AN application fully isolated in a container must be self-contained" - e.g. namespages, CGroups, Kernel capabilities...
    - But this has gone "wrong"
      - might be 7.4MB ('good') but operationally this is "bad": A large organisation won't remember an obscure single-layer container and its contents! And then you can't shell into it, for example!
    - Pattern of observability at the edge is the current security model
      - CVEs are linked to Common Platform Enumeration that matches the packages, which match the distro!
      - The problem becomes introspection of what was built!
        - You should put in versions, metadata etc into your binaries that anyone running the app gets a chance to view commits, references, etc
      - OpenSecurityAgent Admission Controllers can control for vulnerabilities in code, but there is no good solution yet - every solution currently would be a custom one.

## Ziglu: Building a Crypto Bank in the Coud

### Hussein Badakchani (@husseinb)

- Ziglu: "Digital challenger bank"
- Application built in Xamarin (iOS and Android) - least cost of adoption, but poor 3rd party SDK support (AML etc banking SDKs/ APIs). Decision taken by scoring each tech option and going with the highest score
- On the other side, Node scored higher than Go but they went with Go.
  - Issues with Go: High preference for remote (not suitable when it is a high-discovery company as building a team from scratch. Lack of financial/banking/crypto experience in the team. Current demand for Go developers is high (Monzo!)
- Cloud Provider - chose GCP/GKE
  - Positives: Stable, compliant, easy to terraform, Great support (including face to face)
- Build Tools:
  - Bazel: Fast, Powerful, Terse, but: ugly code, documentation is lacking (Zigly head of platforms has made a repository for reference)
- Principles for a startup:
  - NoDev
  - NoOps
  - NoIT
  - See book on Amazon

## THe DevSecOps Iceberg

### Victor Pedersen, WOTT.io

- What is the DevSecOps Iceberg?
  - Application Layer
    - Underneath which are:
  - Container Layer
  - Operating System Layer

- Focus tends to be only on Applications!
  - But if you can root the host box, you're screwed.

When developing code, you have:
- Your code
- Your dependencies (which are the focus here)
Why does this matter? Your app servers are likely exposed to the outside, but you rely on libraries/dependencies for your deployments. But these are attack vectors!
  - e.g. `event-stream` npm package: downloaded millions of times a day as part of many common dependencies.
- When do you run your audit check?
  - During development?
  - During the Pull Request (e.g. Snyk)
  - During CI (which is what we do today)
  - Container registry (if you have a longer-running image)

  - Aqua scanner does a scan of CVEs inside the docker image

The Operating System Layer
  - Commonly neglected these days
  - Often companies misunderstand the responsibilities of cloud vendors ("they will patch things for us, right?")
  - Heartbleed, Spectre and Meltdown were all OS vulnerabilities that then led to further App layer issues
  - Network - if you compromise one node, what will be the effect on your other networked nodes?
  - Assume EVERYTHING IS PUBLIC and configure accordingly!
  - When to run? Continuously on all hosts
    - DevSec.io Server Hardening (<- Check this out! 

WoTT - can report immediately on the state of the server where it is deployed!
  - Shown immediately upon installation of token into server.

Important Conclusions:
   - Understand the threat model to your business
   - Secure all layers in the iceberg!
   - Understand that different layers have different attack vectors

## Introducing Kudo - Kubernetes Operators the Easy Way
### Matt Jarvis, D2iQ (formerly Mesosphere)
@mattj_io
- Kubernetes etc orchestrators work well for Stateless Apps (no data is stored from session to session, execution is not dependent on previous sessions)
- vs Stateful applications - app retains data/state throughout lifecycle (either SQL as a whole or as a synchronised app)
- Kubernetes works well for stateless apps, but not so well for apps that require stable networking/state
  - Enter: StatefulSets: Helps, but Kubernetes doesn't actually know what's going on inside pods.
  - Example: Database clusters during rolling upgrades will NOT be happy
Solutions: Operators. Operators encapsulate operational tasks in code using Custom Resource Definitions.
    - Includes domain-specific operational knowledge and failure/recovery scenarios
    - Operator: Manages and monitors lifecycle
    - Custom Resource Definition: Represent application elements/actions, adding elements to API
  - Operator Framework: RedHat/IBM, implemented using Ansible, Helm or a Go SDK which is complex
  - Kubebuilder framework
  - Developing operators is COMPLEX (10s of thousands of lines of code.), can take up to a coder-year to develop
- D2iQ: Kubernetes Universal Declarative Operator (KUDO)
  - Toolkit and runtime for building of operators
  - Rather than implementing a custom operator each time, using plans that allow operator developers to define declaratively how they want their operator to work.
  - Operator, defined as an OperatorVersion: a complete definition of the application
    - Can create multiple instances of an OperatorVersion within your cluster!
  - Plans: Orchestrate tasks through phases and steps: A "runbook" which can be executed
    ```- Plan foo
      - Phase bar
        - Step 1
      - Phase foo
        - Step 1
        - Step 2
    ```
    - Plans can be viewed in progress with `kubectl kudo plan status --instance :name`
      - Shows the process including download, creation, validation, etc

    - Includes an extension to kubectl CLI tool
  - KUDO roadmap: Piping workflows, Dynamic CRDs (e.g. add a new CRD on the fly), Allowing bootstrapping of KUDO operators from Helm charts, possibly moving away from raw YAML, e.g. Starlark and CUE

## SEcuring DevOps CI/CD Pipelines in the Cloud
### Jesus Escolar - CEO/EXELERYS
### How to framework cybersecurity into DevOps thinking and process
Physical -> Virtual -> Cloud machines -> Containers -> Serverless

What means the word DevOps? - It's an OLD concept
- It was always there but unseen
The original dev model became dysfunctional and ineffective: Development is complex, teams are complex, multidisciplinary
- It's built as continuous integration / continuous delivery: Dev becomes ops becomes dev
- So, what about security? How do you fit it into the dev/release cycle?
  - With the sheer amount of solutions available, did any security analysis get done? Probably not. Do you secure Jira with a third-party app? Do you secure Chef products?
  - The CNCF landscape has too many players. The cake is too small, the resources, time and knowledge is not going to be there for security in the fragmented landscape
  - DevOps wants to:
    - Build secure
    - Ship fast
      - Continuous update may introduce new bugs each time. Think your mobile phone apps
    - Run anywhere
  - You move fast, then fire people rather than finding root causes of why your flaws were introduced in the first place
    - But "security slows me down". Incompatible, unoptimised tools. Missing time to market, or dealing with high security overhead stress. Natural resistance by teams.
  - DevOpsSec
    - Security is at the end of the line. After development and deployment and operations activities. Reactive, assumes patches will be OK. Solutions to individual problems at the end of the line.
  - DevSecOps
    - Development adds security as a part of the process. Developers don't have simple tools or skills to secure the complexity of applications
    - This is the scenario we have today.
  vs:
  - SecDevOps
    - Include security efforts and best practices into the continuous integration and continuous deployment.
    - You're meant to be doing ALL the standard security best practice ANYWAY. Extra security can then be added ON TOP.

  How do we fix the issue?
    - With security frameworks that integrate security into the code building, looks into early detections and analysises historical activities, lower impact of any issues
    - Scan the code when building, scan libraries, analysis of Jenkins integrations, then scan registries, then control admission of what is going into your deployments, and then runtime protection (files, container platform, container hosts protection, intrinsic protection)
    - Mitigation: Vulnerability assessment, vulnerability shielding (this can now be done), malware detection, continously scan, fully automate security scans (so that they happen at every step.)
    
    Use non-signature based anti-malware
    Use behaviour analysis and monitoring
    Machine learning of process trends (deviations)
    Vulnerability analysis and exploit shielding. Microservices and containers is only growing, and it can look as wild west as the early days of physical servers

# The Age of the Cloud Native Security Platform
## Ashley Ward, Palo Alto Networks

Cloud Native: Empower organisations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private and hybrid clouds. DEMOCRATISING. Better, faster, more accessible. Goes back to the Agile Manifesto.

Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach

Boradly think of 3 layers:
- Compute: Software you're continously making
- Service: off the shelf databases and app servers
- Physical: Buildings, metal, silicon

Only 2002 when Virtualisation as a Server by VMWare came out!
  - It's a continuum: You have use cases for each of the stages from physical computers to VMs to containers, to serverless (from stability on one hand to simplicity on the other)

Cloud Native Makes Compute Security Harder!
  - Think about your cloud native infrastrucure. It's abstraction on top of abstraction, especially from a networking standpoint.
  - Everything is ephemeral, and everything is constantly changing, many more entities to secure.
  - Security is largely in the hands of the developer.
  - Security needs to be as portable as the applications.

But Cloud Native Also Makes Security Easier
  - The nature of cloud native applications allows for a new approach to security
    - Declarative
    - Minimalistic
    - Predictable
  - Security that's more automated, efficient and app-aware
  - You don't have to worry (so much) about whether your application is capable and secure and built well etc.

Security throughout the development lifecycle (see Jesus' talk above)
  - It should be something you consider, as it will be about protecting the app and data, but the tools are built to protect the layer
  - Be aware that there are security features to consider in EVERYTHING. And yes it can be fatiguing.
  - We need to be able to have tools that run everywhere, are accessible via APIs and we can consume them rather than from (yet another) dashboard.

  Functional requirements vs Non-functional requirements. Silos for compute vs services. Operational risk & operational control.
